- **Database**: SQLite (can be expanded to other databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Deployment**: Local development environment

### Features:

2. **User Authentication**: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
3. **Login/Logout Functionality**: Users can log in and log out of their accounts securely.
4. **Profile Management**: Users can view and update their profiles, including email, bio, etc.
